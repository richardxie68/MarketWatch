# MarketWatch
Implements Machine Learning concepts, such as a decision tree model to capture patterns and predict prices.

In this project, I constructed a dataframe using GTA's housing data. I started off exploring the data to see what predictors are important in determining the SalePrice of a home. Afterwards, I choose the predictors and constructed a suitable fitting for the model. In order to improve the model and minimize the probability of underfitting and/or overfitting, I implemented a get_mae function to determine the lowest mean error for the data set.

I believe there is tons of possibilies to improve this model in the future. If more analysis is done on how to implement other variables as predictors, then it could help improve the accuracy of the model.

Furthermore, if Toronto MLS allows for real-time retrevial of data from their database, then there could be real-time housing price estimations much like the stock market. This would help home buyers, real estate agents, and developers make important and wise decisions based the current market.
